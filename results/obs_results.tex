In this chapter the results for simple expectation values computed on the lattice gauge field ensembles that have been generated for this work, \cref{runs:ensembles}, are presented. Throughout the chapter, all error estimates associated to expectation values of observables have been computed using the bootstrap method, see \cref{app:resampling}, which is a popular resampling method used when the sample size of a statistical population is small, as is our case. The autocorrelation of data from the ensembles, introduced by the use of Markov chain to generate it, is handled using the procedure found in \cref{app:autocorr} as a correction to the estimate of the variance proportional to the integrated autocorrelation time.

\section{Plaquette and Energy Density} 
The plaquette, \cref{plaquette}, and the energy density, \cref{eq:energy}, are tightly related as they both are estimates of the action of the gauge field.
%  We have already seen in \cref{sec:thermalization} that the plaquette can be used to check whether the metropolis algorithm has thermalized in the early stages of the chain. One could also study the dependence of the plaquette expectation value on the inverse coupling $\beta$ of the gluonic action. In \cref{fig:betplaq} the average plaquette computed for different inverse couplings. 
% \fig[0.7]{results/BetaPlaq.pdf}{Average Plaquette value as a bunction of the inverse coupling $\beta$.}{fig:betplaq}
Since the system is expected, after thermalization, to be at equilibrium, the sampling of the plaquette and of the energy density should be rather constant. To test this we can look, for example, at the value of the observables computed on a single gauge field configuration and plot them in the order in which they were generated, \ref{fig:MCPlaqEnerg}. This is often referred to as the ``Monte Carlo history'' of the observable.

When applying the gradient flow equation:
\beq
\partial_{t_f} V_{t_f}(x,\mu) = - g_0^2 [\partial_{x,\mu}S_G(V_{t_f})]V_{t_f}(x,\mu),
\eeq
the configuration is evolved towards the minimum of the action. That implies that the values for the plaquette and the energy density at sufficiently large flow times are both lattice spacing and flow time independent. The results plotted in \cref{fig:plaq_plot} for the plaquette expectation value as a function of flow time, show that the gradient flow is indeed driving the gauge fields towards the stationary points. From the expression of the Wilson gluonic action, \cref{wilsonaction}, it is clear that the minimum of the action is reached when all the plaquettes are equal to the identity matrix. 
The expectation value of the average plaquette is therefore expected to be exactly one.

The data for all the four ensembles of \cref{runs:ensembles} is shown. Error bars are too small to be visible on the plot.}{fig:plaq_plot}\\
The energy density has an even simpler proportional relation to the action and \cref{fig:energy_plot} proves that the action is indeed minimized in the large flow time limit.

The different data series represent the four different ensembles that have been generated, see \cref{runs:ensembles}. The error bars are not visible on the plot as they are small.}{fig:energy_plot}\\
As discussed in \cref{sec:obs_autocorr}, the integrated autocorrelation time of the observables is a crucial quantity to assess the quality of the results. We therefore computed $\tau_{int}$ for the energies for all the different ensembles at all flow time values. From \cref{fig:energyautocorr} we conclude that for all ensembles we generated the value of $\tau_{int}$ for the energy density never exceeds the value of one at any flow time. This result is suggesting that the data we sampled for this observable is almost uncorrelated. Nevertheless, all results of this work (including \cref{fig:plaq_plot} and \cref{fig:energy_plot}) have variances corrected by $\tilde\sigma^2 = 2\tau_{int}\sigma^2$. The discontinuities in the integrated autocorrelation time stem from different truncations in the windowing procedure described in \cref{app:autocorr}. One can however notice that the values between the jumps are still compatible within the error estimate of $\tau_{int}$ given by \cref{eq:tauint_error}. 
\fig[0.7]{results/EnergyTauInt.pdf}{Integrated autocorrelation time of the Energy Density as a function of the smearing radius $\sqrt{8t_f}$. The discontinuity of the data is given by the approximation given by the truncation procedure described in \cref{app:autocorr}. The method to compute the error bars on $\tau_{int}$ is also found in the same appendix.}{fig:energyautocorr} 
\section{Topological Charge}
Another interesting quantity to compute on our gauge fields is the topological charge, as defined in \cref{eq:topc}. In the continuum theory it assumes only integer values, with a distribution around zero that resembles a gaussian, though there are studies that prove that indeed it is not a normal distribution \cite{ce_non-gaussianities_2015}. \\
The topological charge on the lattice is affected by short range fluctuations given by discretization effects. The smoothing properties of the gradient flow on this observable removes the fluctuations and reveals the ``true'' value of the charge. An illustrative example is to plot the topological charge of one gauge field configuration as a function of the smearing radius. In \cref{fig:topcsingle} we show the evolution of the topological charge for three different gauge field configurations of lattice spacing $a=0.049$ fm ($\beta=6.45$). 
\fig[0.7]{results/TopcSingle.pdf}{Topological charge for three single gauge field configurations, taken at random from the $\beta=6.45$ ensemble, plotted against the smearing radius $\sqrt{8t_f}$ of the gradient flow.}{fig:topcsingle}

We can notice that for all the three considered configurations the topological charge has a plateau at a smearing of roughly $0.15$ fm. The value, for this example, corresponds to approximately three times the lattice spacing.\\ 
For some configurations however, especially for larger lattice spacings, the plateau is not clear and defined. The explanation could be the too simple definition that has been used for the gauge field strength tensor. Perhaps an improved definition of the tensor, given for example by a linear combination of plaquettes and larger Wilson Loops could be beneficial \cite{bilson-thompson_highly-improved_2003,alexandrou_comparison_2017}. These higher order definitions of $G_{\mu\nu}(n)$ can be systematically constructed to cancel the $\mathcal{O}(a^2)$ errors that we have in the current definition. A simple example is to include Wilson loops of size $1\times1$ (the plaquettes),  $2\times1$ and $1\times2$ (minimal rectangles). The topological charge density would then become:
\beq
    q^{imp}(n) = \frac{1}{32\pi^2} c_0 \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\Tr [G_{\mu\nu}^{(clover)}(n)G_{\rho\sigma}^{(clover)}(n)] + c_1 \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\Tr [G_{\mu\nu}^{(rect)}(n)G_{\rho\sigma}^{(rect)}(n)],
\eeq
where $G_{\mu\nu}^{(rect)}(n)$ represents the sum of all Wilson loops in the plane $\mu\nu$ of side 2. The coefficients $c_0$ and $c_1$ are set by looking at the expansion of $G_{\mu\nu}^2(x)$ on the lattice. This potential improvement could be a future addition to our program.

When considering the expectation value of the topological charge of an ensemble, we expect its value to be zero \cite{ce_non-gaussianities_2015}. From \cref{fig:topc} one can check that our data for the expectation value of $\langle Q\rangle$ is in fact within error-bars always compatible with zero. 
\fig[0.7]{results/TopChar.pdf}{Topological charge expectaion value $\langle Q\rangle$ as a function of the smearing radius $\sqrt{8t_f}$. Error bars are computed using bootstrap and corrected with the integrated autocorrelation time correction factor.}{fig:topc}

We should note that the increasing error-bars, for $\beta = 6.2$ and $\beta = 6.45$ in particular, are given by the decreasing lattice spacing. The autocorrelation time of the topological charge increases non linearly with the spacing, so the variance, which we correct according to \cref{eq:tauint}. Another reason for the larger uncertainty is the smaller ensemble size, which for the $\beta = 6.45$ contains a quarter of the gauge fields of the  $\beta=6.00$  case. \\
In \cref{fig:topctauint} we plot the integrated autocorrelation time of the topological charge as a function of flow time. If compared to the analog plot for the energy density (\cref{fig:energyautocorr}) one can notice that the two observables have very different autocorrelation times. The topological charge not only has a much larger $\tau_{int}$ on the lattice, but it grows rapidly with the inverse lattice spacing. It should be noted that the value of $N_{corr}$, the Monte Carlo updates between two data points, is much larger for the $\beta=6.45$ ensemble than all the others, but nevertheless the $\tau_{int}$ is by far larger.
\fig[0.7]{results/TopcTauInt.pdf}{Integrated autocorrelation time $\tau_{int}$ of the topological charge as a function of the gradient flow smearing radius $\sqrt{8t_f}$. The ensembles are the ones reported in \cref{runs:ensembles}. The integrated autocorrelation time and its error bars are computed using the procedure found \cref{app:autocorr}.}{fig:topctauint}

One last consideration on the topological charge is the comparison of its distribution at zero flow time and the one in the large flow time limit. In \cref{fig:topchist} we show two histograms of such distributions for the $\beta = 6.20$ ensemble at $\sqrt{8t_f} = 0$ fm and $\sqrt{8t_f} = 0.6$ fm respectively. The bins are taken to be centered on integer and half-integer values in order to capture differences of the distribution of the topological charge. In the continuum, only integer values should be allowed, while on the lattice, due to discretization, the topological charge is in general not an integer. However, from \cref{fig:topchist} it is possible to see that the gradient flow estimate of the charge has a distribution with much sharper peaks around integer values, rather than half-integer ones, if compared to the zero flow time distribution.

\section{Topological Susceptibility}
The last physical quantity we present in this chapter is the topological susceptibility, \cref{eq:topsus}. Being proportional to the expectation value of the squared topological charge, it is related to the width of the distributions in \cref{fig:topchist}. The evolution with the gradient flow of the susceptibility is not trivial. At large flow times the smoothing property of the gradient flow removes the discretization effects and the real value of the quantity emerges. In \cref{fig:tops} the flow time evolution of the topological susceptibility is shown.
\fig[0.7]{results/TopSusc.pdf}{Topological susceptibility $\chi^{1/4}$ as a function of the smearing radius $\sqrt{8t_f}$, for all the ensembles generated for this work.}{fig:tops} 
 
The value of $\chi^{\frac{1}{4}}$, as defined in \cref{eq:topsus} has the physical units of energy, hence it is reported in MeV. We notice that for all ensembles in the large flow time limit the topological charge has a well defined plateau. \\
The behavior at zero flow time is not what we were expecting, comparing for example to ref. \cite{shindler_nucleon_2015} we don't observe a clear divergency at $\sqrt{8t_f} = 0$ fm for small values of $\beta$. The behavior seems to be more and more divergent (a true divergency is impossible, it is always a finite quantity on the lattice) for larger values of $\beta$. This is because the short-range effects are more pronounced for smaller lattice spacings. A possible explanation for the difference in our results compared to \cite{shindler_nucleon_2015} is the usage of the clover definition of the gauge field strength tensor. Being the topological charge, at zero flow time, dominated by short-distance fluctuations, the use of only $1\times1$ Wilson loops (the four plaquettes of the clover, \cref{fig:clover}) in the definition of $G_{\mu\nu}$ could be a problem. In the reference \cite{shindler_nucleon_2015} the field strength tensor was computed including loops up to size three, this could be the cause of the difference in the low-flow time behavior. This dependence at small flow time of the susceptibility on the definition of the field strength tensor should be investigated more. \\
From \cref{fig:tops} one can infer that the continuum limit, to recover the physical value of the topological susceptibility, can be taken by considering the value of the observable over an interval of the smearing radius between  $\sqrt{8t_f} = 0.4$ and $0.6$ fm. In principle the continuum limit could be taken at any point for the flow time. However, large discretization effects would appear at small flow time. In practice it is easier to extrapolate to the continuum in regions where all the different data series (one for each lattice spacing) have become constant. \\
In our case the extrapolation to the continuum has to be performed by using the dimensionless quantity $(a/r_0)^2$, with $a$ being the lattice spacing and $r_0 = 0.5$ fm the Sommer parameter \cite{guagnelli_precision_1998}. The ratio is taken squared in order to match the order of the discretization effects of the quantity that is being extrapolated, the susceptibility in this case. In \cref{fig:topscontlimit} the continuum limit of the topological susceptibility is taken using the values found for $\sqrt{8t_f}=0.5$ fm.   

\fig[0.7]{results/TopsContLimit.pdf}{Continuum limit extrapolation of $\chi^{\frac{1}{4}}$ from the values at $\sqrt{8t_f}=0.5$ fm. The fit is performed using the dimensionless quantity $(a/r_0)^2$ as a reference scale. The red line and the red errorband represent the fit on all the points and its $1\sigma$ confidence interval. The black point is the extrapolated point from this fit. The green line and its associated errorband are the result of fitting only the three smallest lattice spacings.  The dark green point is the continuum limit extrapolation of the latter fit.}{fig:topscontlimit}

The value we obtain for the extrapolated topological susceptibility is:
\beq
    \chi^{\frac{1}{4}} = 186.9(8.6)~\text{MeV} .
    \label{val:tops}
\eeq 
This is compatible with the value in \cite{shindler_nucleon_2015} of  $\chi^{\frac{1}{4}} = 195.9(4.9)~\text{MeV} $ and with that of \cite{ce_testing_2015} reported as $\chi^{\frac{1}{4}} = 185(5)$. However, from \cref{fig:topscontlimit} one can notice that the result highly depends on the choice of the fit. If the coarsest lattice is neglected the extrapolated value for the topological susceptibility becomes $\chi^{\frac{1}{4}}= 171.7(9.8)~\text{MeV}$. This value, even if still compatible with the previous one shows that there is a systematic uncertainty given by the choice of the fit domain. The  dependence of the topological susceptibility on the definition of the topological charge and a better assessment of the systematic uncertainties of the continuum limit extrapolation are the current study of a future master thesis by H.M. Vege. 

As an additional result we can use this extrapolation to compute the mass of the $\eta'$ meson taken from the Witten-Veneziano formula \cite{witten_current_1979}:
\beq
    \chi = \frac{F_\pi^2m_{\eta'}^2}{2N_{flavors}}.
\eeq 
Using as inputs $F_\pi = 92$ MeV, the pion decay constant, and having $N_{flavors} = 3$, we find the mass of the $\eta'$ meson to be:
\beq    
    m^{(lattice)}_{\eta'} = \sqrt{\frac{\chi 2N_{flavors}}{F_\pi^2}} = 930(27)~\text{MeV},
\eeq
which we compare with the experimental value  $m^{(exp)}_{\eta'} = 957.78(6)$ MeV \cite{dissertori_9._2016}. Our results is in agreement with the reference, but this does no mean the calculation is valid. The value we have obtained should be considered carefully, as we have shown that its uncertainty is unreliable. It has been mainly shown for pedagogical purposes.
