	abstract = {We propose a new method to calculate electric dipole moments induced by the strong QCD \${\textbackslash}theta\$-term. The method is based on the gradient flow for gauge fields and is free from renormalization ambiguities. We test our method by computing the nucleon electric dipole moments in pure Yang-Mills theory at several lattice spacings, enabling a first-of-its-kind continuum extrapolation. The method is rather general and can be applied for any quantity computed in a \${\textbackslash}theta\$ vacuum. This first application of the gradient flow has been successful and demonstrates proof-of-principle, thereby providing a novel method to obtain precise results for nucleon and light nuclear electric dipole moments.},

Two-nucleon interactions have been worked out up to sixth order of chiral perturbation theory and three-nucleon forces up to ﬁfth order. Applications of some of these forces have been conducted in nuclear few- and many-body systems—with a certain degree of success. But in spite of these achievements, we are still faced with great challenges. Among them is the issue of a proper uncertainty quantiﬁcation of predictions obtained when applying these forces in ab initio calculations of nuclear structure and reactions. A related problem is the order by order convergence of the chiral expansion. We start this review with a pedagogical introduction and then present the current status of the ﬁeld of chiral nuclear forces. This is followed by a discussion of representative examples for the application of chiral two- and three-body forces in the nuclear many-body system including convergence issues.},

We start with the fundamental issue of confinement of quarks in the theory of the strong interactions, and discuss how lattice QCD provides a framework for understanding this phenomenon. A conceptual issue with lattice QCD is a conflict of space-time lattice with chiral symmetry of quarks. We discuss how this problem is resolved. Since lattice QCD is a non-linear quantum dynamical system with infinite degrees of freedom, quantities which are analytically calculable are limited. On the other hand, it provides an ideal case of massively parallel numerical computations. We review the long and distinguished history of parallel-architecture supercomputers designed and built for lattice QCD. We discuss algorithmic developments, in particular the difficulties posed by the fermionic nature of quarks, and their resolution. The triad of efforts toward better understanding of physics, better algorithms, and more powerful supercomputers have produced major breakthroughs in our understanding of the strong interactions. We review the salient results of this effort in understanding the hadron spectrum, the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements and CP violation, and quark-gluon plasma at high temperatures. We conclude with a brief summary and a future perspective.},

It is shown how to quantize a gauge field theory on a discrete lattice in Euclidean space-time, preserving exact gauge invariance and treating the gauge fields as angular variables (which makes a gauge-fixing term unnecessary). The lattice gauge theory has a computable strong-coupling limit; in this limit the binding mechanism applies and there are no free quarks. There is unfortunately no Lorentz (or Euclidean) invariance in the strong-coupling limit. The strong-coupling expansion involves sums over all quark paths and sums over all surfaces (on the lattice) joining quark paths. This structure is reminiscent of relativistic string models of hadrons.},

We concentrate on one small-volume ensemble with 2 flavours of dynamical, maximally twisted mass fermions and use three more ensembles to analyze the approach to the continuum limit. We investigate several fermionic and gluonic definitions. The former include the index of the overlap Dirac operator, the spectral flow of the Wilson--Dirac operator and the spectral projectors. For the latter, we take into account different discretizations of the topological charge operator and various smoothing schemes to filter out ultraviolet fluctuations: the gradient flow, stout smearing, APE smearing, HYP smearing and cooling. We show that it is possible to perturbatively match different smoothing schemes and provide a well-defined smoothing scale. We relate the smoothing parameters for cooling, stout and APE smearing to the gradient flow time \${\textbackslash}tau\$. In the case of hypercubic smearing the matching is performed numerically. We investigate which conditions have to be met to obtain a valid definition of the topological charge and susceptibility and we argue that all valid definitions are highly correlated and allow good control over topology on the lattice.},

Through \$R\_0\$ we determine the energy scale in the recently calculated running coupling, which used the recursive finite size technique to reach large energy scales.

	abstract = {The gradient flow in non-abelian gauge theories on R{\textasciicircum}4 is defined by a local diffusion equation that evolves the gauge field as a function of the flow time in a gauge-covariant manner. Similarly to the case of the Langevin equation, the correlation functions of the time-dependent field can be expanded in perturbation theory, the Feynman rules being those of a renormalizable field theory on R{\textasciicircum}4 x [0,oo). For any matter multiplet and to all loop orders, we show that the correlation functions are finite, i.e. do not require additional renormalization, once the theory in four dimensions is renormalized in the usual way. The flow thus maps the gauge field to a one-parameter family of smooth renormalized fields.},

	abstract = {We study the topological charge distribution of the SU(3) Yang–Mills theory with high precision in order to be able to detect deviations from Gaussianity. The computation is carried out on the lattice with high statistics Monte Carlo simulations by implementing a naive discretization of the topological charge evolved with the Yang–Mills gradient ﬂow. This deﬁnition is far less demanding than the one suggested from Neuberger’s fermions and, as shown in this paper, in the continuum limit its cumulants coincide with those of the universal deﬁnition appearing in the chiral Ward identities. Thanks to the range of lattice volumes and spacings considered, we can extrapolate the results for the second and fourth cumulant of the topological charge distribution to the continuum limit with conﬁdence by keeping ﬁnite volume eﬀects negligible with respect to the statistical errors. Our best results for the topological susceptibility is t20 χ = 6.67(7) × 10−4, where t0 is a standard reference scale, while for the ratio of the forth cumulant over the second we obtain R = 0.233(45). The latter is compatible with the expectations from the large Nc expansion, while it rules out the θ-behavior of the vacuum energy predicted by the dilute instanton model. Its large distance from 1 implies that, in the ensemble of gauge conﬁgurations that dominate the path integral, the ﬂuctuations of the topological charge are of quantum non-perturbative nature.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00696},
	abstract = {In this paper, we show a comparison of different definitions of the topological charge on the lattice. We concentrate on one small-volume ensemble with 2 flavours of dynamical, maximally twisted mass fermions and use three more ensembles to analyze the approach to the continuum limit. We investigate several fermionic and gluonic definitions. The former include the index of the overlap Dirac operator, the spectral flow of the Wilson--Dirac operator and the spectral projectors. For the latter, we take into account different discretizations of the topological charge operator and various smoothing schemes to filter out ultraviolet fluctuations: the gradient flow, stout smearing, APE smearing, HYP smearing and cooling. We show that it is possible to perturbatively match different smoothing schemes and provide a well-defined smoothing scale. We relate the smoothing parameters for cooling, stout and APE smearing to the gradient flow time \${\textbackslash}tau\$. In the case of hypercubic smearing the matching is performed numerically. We investigate which conditions have to be met to obtain a valid definition of the topological charge and susceptibility and we argue that all valid definitions are highly correlated and allow good control over topology on the lattice.},
