	abstract = {We propose a new method to calculate electric dipole moments induced by the strong {QCD} \${\textbackslash}theta\$-term. The method is based on the gradient flow for gauge fields and is free from renormalization ambiguities. We test our method by computing the nucleon electric dipole moments in pure Yang-Mills theory at several lattice spacings, enabling a first-of-its-kind continuum extrapolation. The method is rather general and can be applied for any quantity computed in a \${\textbackslash}theta\$ vacuum. This first application of the gradient flow has been successful and demonstrates proof-of-principle, thereby providing a novel method to obtain precise results for nucleon and light nuclear electric dipole moments.},

The Italian community is strongly involved in the present and future programme of the {ALICE} experiment, the upgrade of which will open, in the 2020s, a new phase of high-precision characterisation of the {QGP} properties at the {LHC}. As a complement of this main activity, there is a growing interest in a possible future experiment at the {SPS}, which would target the search for the onset of deconfinement using dimuon measurements.

Two-nucleon interactions have been worked out up to sixth order of chiral perturbation theory and three-nucleon forces up to ﬁfth order. Applications of some of these forces have been conducted in nuclear few- and many-body systems—with a certain degree of success. But in spite of these achievements, we are still faced with great challenges. Among them is the issue of a proper uncertainty quantiﬁcation of predictions obtained when applying these forces in ab initio calculations of nuclear structure and reactions. A related problem is the order by order convergence of the chiral expansion. We start this review with a pedagogical introduction and then present the current status of the ﬁeld of chiral nuclear forces. This is followed by a discussion of representative examples for the application of chiral two- and three-body forces in the nuclear many-body system including convergence issues.},

We start with the fundamental issue of confinement of quarks in the theory of the strong interactions, and discuss how lattice {QCD} provides a framework for understanding this phenomenon. A conceptual issue with lattice {QCD} is a conflict of space-time lattice with chiral symmetry of quarks. We discuss how this problem is resolved. Since lattice {QCD} is a non-linear quantum dynamical system with infinite degrees of freedom, quantities which are analytically calculable are limited. On the other hand, it provides an ideal case of massively parallel numerical computations. We review the long and distinguished history of parallel-architecture supercomputers designed and built for lattice {QCD}. We discuss algorithmic developments, in particular the difficulties posed by the fermionic nature of quarks, and their resolution. The triad of efforts toward better understanding of physics, better algorithms, and more powerful supercomputers have produced major breakthroughs in our understanding of the strong interactions. We review the salient results of this effort in understanding the hadron spectrum, the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements and {CP} violation, and quark-gluon plasma at high temperatures. We conclude with a brief summary and a future perspective.},

It is shown how to quantize a gauge field theory on a discrete lattice in Euclidean space-time, preserving exact gauge invariance and treating the gauge fields as angular variables (which makes a gauge-fixing term unnecessary). The lattice gauge theory has a computable strong-coupling limit; in this limit the binding mechanism applies and there are no free quarks. There is unfortunately no Lorentz (or Euclidean) invariance in the strong-coupling limit. The strong-coupling expansion involves sums over all quark paths and sums over all surfaces (on the lattice) joining quark paths. This structure is reminiscent of relativistic string models of hadrons.},

We concentrate on one small-volume ensemble with 2 flavours of dynamical, maximally twisted mass fermions and use three more ensembles to analyze the approach to the continuum limit. We investigate several fermionic and gluonic definitions. The former include the index of the overlap Dirac operator, the spectral flow of the Wilson--Dirac operator and the spectral projectors. For the latter, we take into account different discretizations of the topological charge operator and various smoothing schemes to filter out ultraviolet fluctuations: the gradient flow, stout smearing, {APE} smearing, {HYP} smearing and cooling. We show that it is possible to perturbatively match different smoothing schemes and provide a well-defined smoothing scale. We relate the smoothing parameters for cooling, stout and {APE} smearing to the gradient flow time \${\textbackslash}tau\$. In the case of hypercubic smearing the matching is performed numerically. We investigate which conditions have to be met to obtain a valid definition of the topological charge and susceptibility and we argue that all valid definitions are highly correlated and allow good control over topology on the lattice.},

Since \$R\_0\$ is well defined and can be calculated accurately in a Monte Carlo simulation, it is an ideal quantity to set the scale. In {SU}(2) pure gauge theory, we use new data (and \$R\_0\$ to set the scale) to extrapolate \$F(r)\$ to the continuum limit for distances \$r=0.18\${\textasciitilde}fm to \$r=1.1\${\textasciitilde}fm. Through \$R\_0\$ we determine the energy scale in the recently calculated running coupling, which used the recursive finite size technique to reach large energy scales. Also in this case, the lattice data can be extrapolated to the continuum limit. The use of one loop Symanzik improvement is seen to reduce the lattice spacing dependence significantly.

	abstract = {We study the topological charge distribution of the {SU}(3) Yang–Mills theory with high precision in order to be able to detect deviations from Gaussianity. The computation is carried out on the lattice with high statistics Monte Carlo simulations by implementing a naive discretization of the topological charge evolved with the Yang–Mills gradient ﬂow. This deﬁnition is far less demanding than the one suggested from Neuberger’s fermions and, as shown in this paper, in the continuum limit its cumulants coincide with those of the universal deﬁnition appearing in the chiral Ward identities. Thanks to the range of lattice volumes and spacings considered, we can extrapolate the results for the second and fourth cumulant of the topological charge distribution to the continuum limit with conﬁdence by keeping ﬁnite volume eﬀects negligible with respect to the statistical errors. Our best results for the topological susceptibility is t20 χ = 6.67(7) × 10−4, where t0 is a standard reference scale, while for the ratio of the forth cumulant over the second we obtain R = 0.233(45). The latter is compatible with the expectations from the large Nc expansion, while it rules out the θ-behavior of the vacuum energy predicted by the dilute instanton model. Its large distance from 1 implies that, in the ensemble of gauge conﬁgurations that dominate the path integral, the ﬂuctuations of the topological charge are of quantum non-perturbative nature.},

For the latter, we take into account different discretizations of the topological charge operator and various smoothing schemes to filter out ultraviolet fluctuations: the gradient flow, stout smearing, {APE} smearing, {HYP} smearing and cooling. We show that it is possible to perturbatively match different smoothing schemes and provide a well-defined smoothing scale. We relate the smoothing parameters for cooling, stout and {APE} smearing to the gradient flow time \${\textbackslash}tau\$. In the case of hypercubic smearing the matching is performed numerically. We investigate which conditions have to be met to obtain a valid definition of the topological charge and susceptibility and we argue that all valid definitions are highly correlated and allow good control over topology on the lattice.},

	abstract = {Background: The equation of state ({EoS}) of nucleonic matter is central for the understanding of bulk nuclear properties, the physics of neutron star crusts, and the energy release in supernova explosions. Because nuclear matter exhibits a ﬁnely tuned saturation point, its {EoS} also constrains nuclear interactions.
Purpose: This work presents coupled-cluster calculations of inﬁnite nucleonic matter using modern interactions from chiral effective ﬁeld theory ({EFT}). It assesses the role of correlations beyond particle-particle and hole-hole ladders, and the role of three-nucleon forces (3NFs) in nuclear matter calculations with chiral interactions.
Methods: This work employs the optimized nucleon-nucleon (N N ) potential {NNLOopt} at next-to-next-to leading order, and presents coupled-cluster computations of the {EoS} for symmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter. The coupled-cluster method employs up to selected triples clusters and the single-particle space consists of a momentum-space lattice. We compare our results with benchmark calculations and control ﬁnite-size effects and shell oscillations via twist-averaged boundary conditions.
Results: We provide several benchmarks to validate the formalism and show that our results exhibit a good convergence toward the thermodynamic limit. Our calculations agree well with recent coupled-cluster results based on a partial wave expansion and particle-particle and hole-hole ladders. For neutron matter at low densities, and for simple potential models, our calculations agree with results from quantum Monte Carlo computations. While neutron matter with interactions from chiral {EFT} is perturbative, symmetric nuclear matter requires nonperturbative approaches. Correlations beyond the standard particle-particle ladder approximation yield nonnegligible contributions. The saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter is sensitive to the employed 3NFs and the employed regularization scheme. 3NFs with nonlocal cutoffs exhibit a considerably improved convergence than their local cousins. We are unable to ﬁnd values for the parameters of the short-range part of the local 3NF that simultaneously yield acceptable values for the saturation point in symmetric nuclear matter and the binding energies of light nuclei.
Conclusions: Coupled-cluster calculations with nuclear interactions from chiral {EFT} yield nonperturbative results for the {EoS} of nucleonic matter. Finite-size effects and effects of truncations can be controlled. For the optimization of chiral forces, it might be useful to include the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter.},

	abstract = {Monte Carlo statistical methods, particularly those based on Markov chains, are now an essential component of the standard set of techniques used by statisticians. This new edition has been revised towards a coherent and flowing coverage of these simulation techniques, with incorporation of the most recent developments in the field. In particular, the introductory coverage of random variable generation has been totally revised, with many concepts being unified through a fundamental theorem of simulation There are five completely new chapters that cover Monte Carlo control, reversible jump, slice sampling, sequential Monte Carlo, and perfect sampling. There is a more in-depth coverage of Gibbs sampling, which is now contained in three consecutive chapters. The development of Gibbs sampling starts with slice sampling and its connection with the fundamental theorem of simulation, and builds up to two-stage Gibbs sampling and its theoretical properties. A third chapter covers the multi-stage Gibbs sampler and its variety of applications. Lastly, chapters from the previous edition have been revised towards easier access, with the examples getting more detailed coverage. This textbook is intended for a second year graduate course, but will also be useful to someone who either wants to apply simulation techniques for the resolution of practical problems or wishes to grasp the fundamental principles behind those methods. The authors do not assume familiarity with Monte Carlo techniques (such as random variable generation), with computer programming, or with any Markov chain theory (the necessary concepts are developed in Chapter 6). A solutions manual, which covers approximately 40\% of the problems, is available for instructors who require the book for a course. Christian P.

This leads to a theory for the order conditions, which can be developed in a completely coordinate free manner . Although this theory is developed in a language that is not widely used in applied mathematics, it is structurally simple . The recursion for the order conditions rests mainly on three lemmas, each with very short proofs .
