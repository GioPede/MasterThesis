	abstract = {We propose a new method to calculate electric dipole moments induced by the strong {QCD} \${\textbackslash}theta\$-term. The method is based on the gradient flow for gauge fields and is free from renormalization ambiguities. We test our method by computing the nucleon electric dipole moments in pure Yang-Mills theory at several lattice spacings, enabling a first-of-its-kind continuum extrapolation. The method is rather general and can be applied for any quantity computed in a \${\textbackslash}theta\$ vacuum. This first application of the gradient flow has been successful and demonstrates proof-of-principle, thereby providing a novel method to obtain precise results for nucleon and light nuclear electric dipole moments.},

The Italian community is strongly involved in the present and future programme of the {ALICE} experiment, the upgrade of which will open, in the 2020s, a new phase of high-precision characterisation of the {QGP} properties at the {LHC}. As a complement of this main activity, there is a growing interest in a possible future experiment at the {SPS}, which would target the search for the onset of deconfinement using dimuon measurements.

Two-nucleon interactions have been worked out up to sixth order of chiral perturbation theory and three-nucleon forces up to ﬁfth order. Applications of some of these forces have been conducted in nuclear few- and many-body systems—with a certain degree of success. But in spite of these achievements, we are still faced with great challenges. Among them is the issue of a proper uncertainty quantiﬁcation of predictions obtained when applying these forces in ab initio calculations of nuclear structure and reactions. A related problem is the order by order convergence of the chiral expansion. We start this review with a pedagogical introduction and then present the current status of the ﬁeld of chiral nuclear forces. This is followed by a discussion of representative examples for the application of chiral two- and three-body forces in the nuclear many-body system including convergence issues.},

We start with the fundamental issue of confinement of quarks in the theory of the strong interactions, and discuss how lattice {QCD} provides a framework for understanding this phenomenon. A conceptual issue with lattice {QCD} is a conflict of space-time lattice with chiral symmetry of quarks. We discuss how this problem is resolved. Since lattice {QCD} is a non-linear quantum dynamical system with infinite degrees of freedom, quantities which are analytically calculable are limited. On the other hand, it provides an ideal case of massively parallel numerical computations. We review the long and distinguished history of parallel-architecture supercomputers designed and built for lattice {QCD}. We discuss algorithmic developments, in particular the difficulties posed by the fermionic nature of quarks, and their resolution. The triad of efforts toward better understanding of physics, better algorithms, and more powerful supercomputers have produced major breakthroughs in our understanding of the strong interactions. We review the salient results of this effort in understanding the hadron spectrum, the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements and {CP} violation, and quark-gluon plasma at high temperatures. We conclude with a brief summary and a future perspective.},

It is shown how to quantize a gauge field theory on a discrete lattice in Euclidean space-time, preserving exact gauge invariance and treating the gauge fields as angular variables (which makes a gauge-fixing term unnecessary). The lattice gauge theory has a computable strong-coupling limit; in this limit the binding mechanism applies and there are no free quarks. There is unfortunately no Lorentz (or Euclidean) invariance in the strong-coupling limit. The strong-coupling expansion involves sums over all quark paths and sums over all surfaces (on the lattice) joining quark paths. This structure is reminiscent of relativistic string models of hadrons.},

We concentrate on one small-volume ensemble with 2 flavours of dynamical, maximally twisted mass fermions and use three more ensembles to analyze the approach to the continuum limit. We investigate several fermionic and gluonic definitions. The former include the index of the overlap Dirac operator, the spectral flow of the Wilson--Dirac operator and the spectral projectors. For the latter, we take into account different discretizations of the topological charge operator and various smoothing schemes to filter out ultraviolet fluctuations: the gradient flow, stout smearing, {APE} smearing, {HYP} smearing and cooling. We show that it is possible to perturbatively match different smoothing schemes and provide a well-defined smoothing scale. We relate the smoothing parameters for cooling, stout and {APE} smearing to the gradient flow time \${\textbackslash}tau\$. In the case of hypercubic smearing the matching is performed numerically. We investigate which conditions have to be met to obtain a valid definition of the topological charge and susceptibility and we argue that all valid definitions are highly correlated and allow good control over topology on the lattice.},

Since \$R\_0\$ is well defined and can be calculated accurately in a Monte Carlo simulation, it is an ideal quantity to set the scale. In {SU}(2) pure gauge theory, we use new data (and \$R\_0\$ to set the scale) to extrapolate \$F(r)\$ to the continuum limit for distances \$r=0.18\${\textasciitilde}fm to \$r=1.1\${\textasciitilde}fm. Through \$R\_0\$ we determine the energy scale in the recently calculated running coupling, which used the recursive finite size technique to reach large energy scales. Also in this case, the lattice data can be extrapolated to the continuum limit. The use of one loop Symanzik improvement is seen to reduce the lattice spacing dependence significantly.
