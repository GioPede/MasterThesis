	abstract = {We propose a new method to calculate electric dipole moments induced by the strong QCD \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtheta\$-term. The method is based on the gradient flow for gauge fields and is free from renormalization ambiguities. We test our method by computing the nucleon electric dipole moments in pure Yang-Mills theory at several lattice spacings, enabling a first-of-its-kind continuum extrapolation. The method is rather general and can be applied for any quantity computed in a \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtheta\$ vacuum. This first application of the gradient flow has been successful and demonstrates proof-of-principle, thereby providing a novel method to obtain precise results for nucleon and light nuclear electric dipole moments.},

The Italian community is strongly involved in the present and future programme of the ALICE experiment, the upgrade of which will open, in the 2020s, a new phase of high-precision characterisation of the QGP properties at the LHC. As a complement of this main activity, there is a growing interest in a possible future experiment at the SPS, which would target the search for the onset of deconfinement using dimuon measurements. On a longer timescale, the community looks with interest at the ongoing studies and discussions on a possible fixed-target programme using the LHC ion beams and on the Future Circular Collider.},

Two-nucleon interactions have been worked out up to sixth order of chiral perturbation theory and three-nucleon forces up to ﬁfth order. Applications of some of these forces have been conducted in nuclear few- and many-body systems—with a certain degree of success. But in spite of these achievements, we are still faced with great challenges. Among them is the issue of a proper uncertainty quantiﬁcation of predictions obtained when applying these forces in ab initio calculations of nuclear structure and reactions. A related problem is the order by order convergence of the chiral expansion. We start this review with a pedagogical introduction and then present the current status of the ﬁeld of chiral nuclear forces. This is followed by a discussion of representative examples for the application of chiral two- and three-body forces in the nuclear many-body system including convergence issues.},

We start with the fundamental issue of confinement of quarks in the theory of the strong interactions, and discuss how lattice QCD provides a framework for understanding this phenomenon. A conceptual issue with lattice QCD is a conflict of space-time lattice with chiral symmetry of quarks. We discuss how this problem is resolved. Since lattice QCD is a non-linear quantum dynamical system with infinite degrees of freedom, quantities which are analytically calculable are limited. On the other hand, it provides an ideal case of massively parallel numerical computations. We review the long and distinguished history of parallel-architecture supercomputers designed and built for lattice QCD. We discuss algorithmic developments, in particular the difficulties posed by the fermionic nature of quarks, and their resolution. The triad of efforts toward better understanding of physics, better algorithms, and more powerful supercomputers have produced major breakthroughs in our understanding of the strong interactions. We review the salient results of this effort in understanding the hadron spectrum, the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements and CP violation, and quark-gluon plasma at high temperatures. We conclude with a brief summary and a future perspective.},

It is shown how to quantize a gauge field theory on a discrete lattice in Euclidean space-time, preserving exact gauge invariance and treating the gauge fields as angular variables (which makes a gauge-fixing term unnecessary). The lattice gauge theory has a computable strong-coupling limit; in this limit the binding mechanism applies and there are no free quarks. There is unfortunately no Lorentz (or Euclidean) invariance in the strong-coupling limit. The strong-coupling expansion involves sums over all quark paths and sums over all surfaces (on the lattice) joining quark paths. This structure is reminiscent of relativistic string models of hadrons.},

We concentrate on one small-volume ensemble with 2 flavours of dynamical, maximally twisted mass fermions and use three more ensembles to analyze the approach to the continuum limit. We investigate several fermionic and gluonic definitions. The former include the index of the overlap Dirac operator, the spectral flow of the Wilson–Dirac operator and the spectral projectors. For the latter, we take into account different discretizations of the topological charge operator and various smoothing schemes to filter out ultraviolet fluctuations: the gradient flow, stout smearing, APE smearing, HYP smearing and cooling. We show that it is possible to perturbatively match different smoothing schemes and provide a well-defined smoothing scale. We relate the smoothing parameters for cooling, stout and APE smearing to the gradient flow time \${\textbackslash}textbackslashtau\$. In the case of hypercubic smearing the matching is performed numerically. We investigate which conditions have to be met to obtain a valid definition of the topological charge and susceptibility and we argue that all valid definitions are highly correlated and allow good control over topology on the lattice.},

	abstract = {We construct generalized Runge-Kutta methods for integration of differential equations evolving on a Lie group. The methods are using intrinsic operations on the group, and we are hence guaranteed that the numerical solution will evolve on the correct manifold. Our methods must satisfy two different criteria to achieve a given order: 9 Coefficients Ai,j and bj must satisfy the classical order conditions. This is done by picking the coefficients of any classical RK scheme of the given order. 9 We must construct functions to correct for certain non-commutative effects to the given order. These tasks are completely independent, so once correction functions are found to the given order, we can turn any classical RK scheme into an RK method of the same order on any Lie group.},

	abstract = {Runge-Kutta methods are formulated via coordinate independent operations on manifolds . It is shown that there is an intimate connection between Lie series and Lie groups on one hand and Butcher's celebrated theory of order conditions on the other. In Butcher's theory the elementary differentials are represented as trees . In the present formulation they appear as commutators between vector fields . This leads to a theory for the order conditions, which can be developed in a completely coordinate free manner . Although this theory is developed in a language that is not widely used in applied mathematics, it is structurally simple . The recursion for the order conditions rests mainly on three lemmas, each with very short proofs . The techniques used in the analysis are prepared for studying RK-like methods on general Lie groups and homogeneous manifolds, but these themes are not studied in detail within the present paper .},

	abstract = {We study the topological charge distribution of the SU(3) Yang–Mills theory with high precision in order to be able to detect deviations from Gaussianity. The computation is carried out on the lattice with high statistics Monte Carlo simulations by implementing a naive discretization of the topological charge evolved with the Yang–Mills gradient ﬂow. This deﬁnition is far less demanding than the one suggested from Neuberger’s fermions and, as shown in this paper, in the continuum limit its cumulants coincide with those of the universal deﬁnition appearing in the chiral Ward identities. Thanks to the range of lattice volumes and spacings considered, we can extrapolate the results for the second and fourth cumulant of the topological charge distribution to the continuum limit with conﬁdence by keeping ﬁnite volume eﬀects negligible with respect to the statistical errors. Our best results for the topological susceptibility is t20 χ = 6.67(7) × 10−4, where t0 is a standard reference scale, while for the ratio of the forth cumulant over the second we obtain R = 0.233(45). The latter is compatible with the expectations from the large Nc expansion, while it rules out the θ-behavior of the vacuum energy predicted by the dilute instanton model. Its large distance from 1 implies that, in the ensemble of gauge conﬁgurations that dominate the path integral, the ﬂuctuations of the topological charge are of quantum non-perturbative nature.},
