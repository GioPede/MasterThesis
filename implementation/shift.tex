    \caption{Parallelization scheme based on lattice shifts. When, for example in the staples computation, a link needs to be multiplied by a neighboring one, a new lattice is created. It is filled with the shifted link, which is fetched either from the local sub-lattice if it is in the central region, or from the neighbors if it is on the edge. This schematic drawing shows how a shift along the ``right'' direction is performed. A new lattice containing the data of the target link is created by filling it with the target links. The circled regions in \cref{subfig:shift}, the edges, are shared using MPI by first creating a ``buffer'' of the shape of the edge (it is a cube in the real simulation) and it is sent in a single message to the neighbor which unpacks it in the right location. The new lattice is the multiplied with the original one on a site by site basis, which now is only a local operation.}
